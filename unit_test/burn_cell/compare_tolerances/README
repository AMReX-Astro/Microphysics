# Comparing tolerances

This is used the make the plot in the docs that compares tolerances.

Compile `burn_cell` with `aprox13` and run the tests using the script
`run_tol_compare.sh`.  This will run 4 different instances with different
tolerances.

A plot comparing the relative error of the simulations (using the run with
the tightest tolerances as the reference) can be made with `plot-tols.py`.
