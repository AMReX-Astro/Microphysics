# Tabular NSE

``nse_tabular`` provides support for reading in and interpolating from
a tabulation of an NSE state from a large collection of nuclei.  The
idea is that this table will be used where the thermodynamic state has
entered NSE (high T, rho) and a regular network will be used
elsewhere.

This requires compiling with

```
USE_NSE_TABLE=TRUE
```

This will change the equation of state to work in terms of (Y_e, abar,
B/A) and those quantities will be added to the aux state in the
network.

Interpolation from the table is done with a tricubic interpolating
polynomial.


## Table contents

The table provides:

* log10(rho) : density in CGS

* log10(T) : temperature in K

* Ye : electron fraction

* Abar : mean molecular weight ($1/\bar{A} = \sum_k X_k / A_k$)

* <B/A> : average binding energy per nucleon in MeV
 ($\langle B/A \rangle = \sum_k X_k B_k / A_k$)

* dYe/dt : evolution of the electron fraction in 1/s

* dAbar/dt : evolution of Abar in 1/s

* d<B/A>/dt : evolution of <B/A> in MeV/s

* e_nu : weak rate neutrino loss energy in erg/g/s

* X(A), X(B), ... : the reduced composition mass fractions.  They are
  assumed to be in the same order as the nuclei in the on-grid network.


## Generating the table

Table generation is managed via pynucastro.  For the current table
in Microphysics, the script `make_nse_table.py` will create the
NSE state at a number of table grid points and output the table
as a file.  There are a few things to control here:

* The nuclei used in the NSE calculation.

  Currently we use 98.  The main limits are lake of weak rates
  for some with lower A and lack of reliable spins for very
  neutron rich nuclei.

* The "on-grid" network to reduce down to.

  This requires writing a function that bins the NSE nuclei down to
  the nuclei carried on the grid.  Presently the script does this for
  `aprox19`.

* The number of grid points and the extrema

  It doesn't make sense to consider temperatures below 1.e9 K and very
  low Ye requires a lot of nuclei with low Z/A to ensure that the NSE
  solver converges well.

  Sometimes the solver can fail to converge, but may do so if a better
  initial guess for the chemical potentials is provided.  There is an
  attempt to cache the chemical potentials that worked for the last
  temperature to hopefully accelerate the convergence.

The script will take a long time to run.  Upon completion, the
following should be copied into the on-grid network's subdirectory
(e.g. `networks/aprox19/`):

* `nse.tbl` : this is the table itself.  *It should really be renamed
  do something like* `nse_<network>.tbl`, where `<network>` is
  replaced by the network name, e.g. `aprox19`.

* `nse_table_size.H` : this contains the information about the table
  size needed to allocate the memory to store the table and to index
  into it.  Note the `table_name` string in the header should be
  updated to reflect the new name of the table.

The data is ordered such that rho varies the slowest (from low to
high), T varies the next slowest (from low to high), and Ye varies the
fastest (from high to low).

## Outputting for a different network

At the moment, the script is configured for ``aprox19``.  To change it
to output to a different network, a new function needs to be added in
the same form as the ``get_aprox19_comp`` function.  The job of that
run is to reduce the composition down to that of the network on the
grid.  The main thing that would need to be done is to change the list
of nuclei and update the list ``X[]`` to output them in the proper
order.
