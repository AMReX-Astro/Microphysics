# Tabular NSE

``aprox19`` can model nuclear statistical equilibrium at high
densities.  This is accomplished by switching from integrating the ODE
system of 19 nuclei to doing a table look-up on the results from a
network with 125 nuclei.

The NSE table was provided by Stan Woosley:

from Stan:

> Probably all the code needs for hydrodynamics and energy generation
> is abar and Ye (given rho and T) so to follow explosions you can use
> the smaller table. It also gives crude measures of nucleosyntheis in
> n+p+helium, si-ca, fe group. Probably good enough for NSE
>
> If you are following bufk nucleosynthesis you can use the larger table
> which gives 125 isotopes packaged into 19 (CASTRO used to use the 19
> iso network of KEPLER, maybe it no longer does?). These abundances can
> be interpolated by a simple extension of the usetable.f routine to
> more variables

The mapping of the nuclei from the large network to the 19 we carry is:

* 1: is H1  is 0
* 2: is mostly 3He
* 3: 4He
* 4: 12C
* 5: 14N
* 6: 16O
* 7: 20Ne
* 8: 24Mg
* 9: 28Si
* 10: 32S
* 11: 36Ar
* 12: 40Ca
* 13: 44Ti
* 14: 48Cr
* 15: 52Fe
* 16: all other iron group except 56Ni
* 17: 56Ni
* 18: neutrons
* 19: protons

More from Stan:

> The Ye of those 19 isotopes may not agree exactly with the Ye of the
> table and the latter should be used in the hydro and EOS. In fact
> since the A of abund 16 is not given, Ye is indeterminate.

> Carrying all these isotopes merely adds to the memory so long as you
> are in nse, but if you are following a continuum of burning from He
> (or H) to NSE you may need them.  In fact, I think all burning
> stages can be handled with tables e.g. for carbon burning makes
> tables of compsition for carbon burned at constant T and rho and
> interpolate in X12, T and rho, though some thought must e given to
> the initial carbon abundance.

> Anyway the above packing is for a calculation with 125 isotopes. I can

regarding the term dYedt:

What is tabulated is wrate which is the sum of all electron capture
and positron decay rates times the appropriate abundances minus a
similar rate for beta decay and positron capture

 wrate=rectot+rpdtot-redtot-rpctot

So if electron capture dominates wrate is positive

The inference is that it is a positive term that is subtracted from Ye
