There are two tables here which describe the NSE final state.

Both tables give the average binding energy "qbar" in MeV per nucleon, and
mean molecular weight "abar" of material in Nuclear Statistical
equilibrium.  Also given is the neutrino loss rate "edot" (in erg/g/s) and
the net positron capture rate "yedot" (which is usually negative) for the
composition in the NSE state.  (Note this does not include "pure" neutrino
"cooling" only neutrinos produced in nuclear interactions like electron
capture or positron decay.)

nse_pres_hmq_table.txt
This gives the properties of the endpoint of a constant-pressure burn at
the specified total enthalpy ( h - qbar ) where both quantities are
ergs/gram.  This is the state that material will have after it is burned by
a nuclear flame.  This is used to predict the state of the NSE ash inside
the flame.

nse_dens_emq_table.txt
This gives the properties of the endpoint of a constant-density burn at the
specified total energy ( e - qbar ) where both quatities are ergs/gram.
This table is used in the fully burned material to allow release of binding
energy due to changes in the NSE state as material expands.

Both tables were generated by Ivo Seitenzahl, see also his notes in corresponding
README_... files
