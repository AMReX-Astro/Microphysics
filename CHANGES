changes since last merge:

 -- we now use MICROPHYSICS_HOME instead of MICROPHYSICS_DIR as the
    environment variable to point to the Microphysics/ directory.

 -- there are now two standalone unit tests, test_react and test_eos
    that don't need Maestro or Castro to compile.

 -- new burn mode that limits numerically unstable burning.

 -- UsersGuide/ was renamed to Docs/ to be consistent with the other
    BoxLib codes

 -- the energy equation now uses an offset to help with the BS ODE 
    integration convergence

 -- the runtime parameter small_x now is owned by the network
