  -- a routine util/cj_detonation was added to compute the
     Chapman-Jouguet detonation velocity for any of the networks

# 18.04

  -- pynucastro (https://github.com/pynucastro/pynucastro) can now
     generate reaction networks compatible with StarKiller.  See the
     subch network.

# 17.11

  -- a new option to boost the reaction rates has been added
     to the integrators (PR #64)

  -- we now disable some composition derivatives in the EOS
     by default, for performance and memory reasons.  They can
     be reenabled by defining the preprocessor variable 
     EXTRA_THERMO (PR #59)

# 17.10

 -- the compositional derivatives are no longer available
    by default from the EOS.  To get these, set the preprocessor
    variable EXTRA_THERMO.  This change was done for performance
    reasons.

 -- the aprox19 and aprox21 networks no longer use a numerical
    Jacobian by default, as this was found to result in some
    bad numerical issues in VODE (PR #49)

 -- the maximum temperature for reactions, MAX_TEMP, is now
    an adjustable input parameter rather than being hardcoded
    at 1.d11.

 -- the Helmholtz EOS table is now read by the IO processor and
    broadcast to other processors (PR #53)

 -- the VODE integrator now does some additional checks on the
    state to ensure consistency (PR #47)

* 17.09

 -- a new rety mechanism was implemented that allows a different
    integrator to be used if the primary integrator fails

 -- the electron Ni56 electron capture rates and energy losses
    were updated from Mazurek (1973) to LMP (2000).  Thanks to
    Carl Fields for this contribution.  Pull request #40


* 17.08

 -- fix to aprox21 from Aron Michel (HITS) that fills in missing
    reactions

 -- updated the helmholtz EOS to use the latest table from Frank
    Timmes (in particular, this is now denser, with 2x points in T and
    rho dimensions).  If you copied the old table, you need to make sure
    you are using the new table now.

 -- add stellar conductivities from Frank Timmes


* 17.06

 -- a new Fortran 90 port of VODE has been added

 -- the unit tests now require AMReX instead of BoxLib to build


* 17.01

 -- we've removed the option to integrate molar fractions and instead
    the ODE system always operates on mass fractions (the networks
    return derivatives of molar fractions and they are automatically
    converted).


* 16.12

 -- a new unit test, test_sdc, was created to test the SDC interface
    to the networks

 -- we now rely on the network module to provide aion_inv (1/aion)

 -- the VODE integrator now supports SDC integration


* 16.09

 -- num_rate_groups is now a property of the individual networks

 -- a new integration method, Rosenbrock, was added to the BS
    option (set ode_method)

 -- the number of RHS and Jac evaluations is now passed out
    of the burner through the burn_t type for diagnostic and
    load-balancing use

 -- support for spectral deferred correction coupling of the
    burner and hydro was added to the BS integrator


* 16.08

 -- Microphysics/eos/ has been renamed Microphysics/EOS/ to better
    conform to the conventions used in Castro and Maestro

 -- the User's Guide has been extensively updated

 -- OpenMP and OpenACC directives have been added to the unit tests

 -- the BS integrator's type, bs_t, has now contains a burn_t
    internally, simplifying the conversion from bs_t to call the
    actual_rhs/jac

 -- the rates() component of burn_t was removed.  We no longer
    rely on rate caching

 -- we now store the simulation time at the start of the burn as
    t0 in the rpar storage to use as an offset to the integration
    time

 -- the species derivatives (dh/dX and de/dX) and enthalpy were
    removed from the burn_t

 -- a new option to integrate of X instead of Y was added
    (integrate_molar_fraction = F)

 -- integration of networks with nspec_evolve < nspec were fixed
    to now apply the algrebic constraint relating mass fractions
    through a new update_unevolved_species() function

 -- the electron capture rate on Ni56 used by aprox19 and aprox21 was
    fixed

 -- the BS integrator can now use the initial timestep estimation
    algorithm that VODE uses 9use_timestep_estimator = T)

 -- a centered difference numerical Jacobian option was added


* 16.07

 -- we now use MICROPHYSICS_HOME instead of MICROPHYSICS_DIR as the
    environment variable to point to the Microphysics/ directory.

 -- there are now two standalone unit tests, test_react and test_eos
    that don't need Maestro or Castro to compile.

 -- new burn mode that limits numerically unstable burning.

 -- UsersGuide/ was renamed to Docs/ to be consistent with the other
    BoxLib codes

 -- the energy equation now uses an offset to help with the BS ODE
    integration convergence

 -- the runtime parameter small_x now is owned by the network
