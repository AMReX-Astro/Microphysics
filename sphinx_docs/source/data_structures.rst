Data Structures
***************

All of the routines in this software package are standardized so that
you interact with them using the same type of data structure, a
Fortran derived type (which, for our purposes, is analogous to a
C++ struct).

EOS
===

``eos_t``
---------

The main data structure for interacting with the EOS is ``eos_t``.
This is a collection of data specifying the microphysical state of the
fluid that we are evaluating. This derived type has many components,
and in the Fortran syntax we access them with the ``%`` operator. For a
particular instantiation named eos_state, the most important
data is the following:

* ``eos_state % rho`` : density [:math:`\mathrm{g~cm^{-3}}`]

* ``eos_state % T`` : temperature [K]

* ``eos_state % p`` : pressure [:math:`\mathrm{erg~cm^{-3}}`]

* ``eos_state % e`` : specific internal energy [:math:`\mathrm{erg~g^{-1}}`]

* ``eos_state % h`` : specific enthalpy [:math:`\mathrm{erg~g^{-1}}`]

* ``eos_state % s`` : specific entropy [:math:`\mathrm{erg~g^{-1}~K^{-1}}`]

* ``eos_state % xn`` : mass fractions of species (this is an array, dimensioned to be the number of species, ``nspec`` )

* ``eos_state % aux`` : any auxiliary variables carried with the fluid (this is an array, dimensioned to be the number of auxiliary quantities, ``naux`` )

Note that both ``nspec`` and ``naux`` are meant to be properties of the
network, and they will come in through the ``network`` module.

There is a lot more information that can be saved here, such as the
partial derivatives of the thermodynamic state variables with respect
to each other. To see a complete list, examine the ``eos_type.f90``
file inside the code calling Microphysics (e.g.
``Castro/Microphysics/EOS/eos_type.f90``).

Networks
========

``burn_t``
----------

The main data structure for interacting with the reaction networks is
``burn_t``. This holds the composition (mass fractions), thermodynamic
state, and a lot of internal information used by the reaction network
(e.g. the righthand side of the ODEs, the Jacobian, etc.). Typically
the user will only need to fill/use the following information:

* ``burn_state % rho``: density [:math:`\mathrm{g~cm^{-3}}`]

* ``burn_state % T``: temperature [K]

* ``burn_state % e``: the specific internal energy [:math:`\mathrm{erg~g^{-1}}`]

   Note: this has two different contexts, depending on when it is
   accessed.

   When you call the integrator and are in the process of integrating
   the reaction system, e will be an integration variable and
   will account for the nuclear energy release. Due to the nature
   of our ODE system, this will not be thermodynamically consistent with
   :math:`\rho, T`

   Upon exit of the integration, the initial internal energy (offset)
   is subtracted off, and e now represents the specifc nuclear
   energy release from the reactions.

* ``burn_state % xn(:)``: the mass fractions

* ``burn_state % aux(:)``: any auxiliary quantities (like :math:`Y_e`)

* ``burn_state % i``, ``% j``, ``% k``: hydrodynamic zone i, j, k for bug reporting, diagnostics

* ``burn_state % time``: the time since the start of the integration [s]

   Note this is not the same as the simulation time. Each integrator
   will also store the simulation time at the start of integration
   in their local storage—this can be used as an offset to convert
   between integration and simulation time.

* ``burn_state % shock``: are we inside of a hydrodynamic shock (the burner may wish to take action in this case)

``rate_t``
----------

The ``rate_t`` structure is used internally in a network to pass the
raw reaction rate information (usually just the temperature-dependent
terms) between various subroutines. It does not come out of the
network-specific righthand side or Jacobian routines.

This main component of this is simply an array of dimension
``rates(num_rate_groups, nrates)``—both of the parameters
used in dimensioning this are network-dependent.

``burn_type_module``
--------------------

In addition to defining the ``burn_t`` type, the ``burn_type_module``
also defines integer indices into the solution vector that can be used
to access the different components of the state:

* ``neqs`` : the total number of variables we are integrating.

   It is assumed that the first ``nspec`` are the species.

* ``net_itemp`` : the index of the temperature in the solution vector

* ``net_ienuc`` : the index of the specifc internal energy in the solution vector

Integrators
===========

Each integrator also has their own internal data structure that holds
the information needed for the integration. Meta-data that is not part
of the integration vector of ODEs, but is attached to a particular
state (:math:`X_k`, :math:`T`, :math:`e`), is stored in an array that
can be passed into the righthand side routine. The different fields
are accessed through the integer indices in the ``rpar_indices`` Fortran
module. The details of this storage is given for each integrator
below.

Converting Between Types
========================

There is significant overlap between ``eos_t`` and ``burn_t``.
The ``burn_type_module`` provides two routines,
``burn_to_eos`` and ``eos_to_burn`` that convert a ``burn_t``
state to an ``eos_t`` state, and back. Only the thermodynamic
variables that are common in the two types are copied. This is
useful, for example, if you have a burn_t state and what to get
thermodynamic information by calling the EOS.

Initial Values and Threadsafety
===============================
