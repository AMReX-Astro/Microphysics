Overview of Unit Tests
**********************

There are a few unit tests in Microphysics that operate on a generic
EOS, reaction network, conductivity, or some smaller component to
Microphysics.  Many of these tests exercise the main interfaces in
``Microphysics/interfaces/`` and the code that those call.

These tests compile using the AMReX build system, which assumes that
main is in C++, so each have a ``main.cpp`` driver.  The files
``Microphysics/Make.Microphysics`` and
``Microphysics/Make.Microphysics_extern`` provide the macros necessary
to build the executable. Runtime parameters are parsed in the same
fashion as in the application codes, using the ``write_probin.py``
script.

.. note::

   Most of these tests work with MPI+OpenMP, MPI+CUDA, and MPI+HIP

Tests are divided into three categories:

* *comprehensive tests* work on a cube of data (usually
  $\rho$, $T$, and composition varying along the three dimensions) and
  are meant to exercise a wide range of input conditions.

  These are mainly used for regression testing.

* *one-zone tests* allow you to evaluate the conditions for a
  particular thermodynamic state.

  These are often used for interactive explorations and within the CI.

* *infrastructure tests* test small bits of the solver, function
  interfaces, or runtime infrastructure.

  These are not really meant for exploring the actual thermodynamic
  state.



Comprehensive tests
===================

Each of these tests sets up a cube of data, $(\rho, T, X_k)$, with the
range of $T$ and $\rho$, and the species to focus on for $X_k$ controlled
by options in the input file.

* ``test_aprox_rates`` :

  call each of the hardcoded rate functions in ``Microphysics/rates/``
  on each cell in the data cube and store the output in a plotfile.

* ``test_conductivity`` :

  call one of the conductivity routines (set via ``CONDUCTIVITY_DIR``)
  on each cell in the data cube and store the output in a plotfile.

* ``test_eos`` :

  call one of the equations of state (set via ``EOS_DIR``) on each
  cell in the data cube. We first call it with $(\rho, T, X_k)$ as
  input (``eos_input_rt``), and then test each of the other EOS modes
  (``eos_input_rh``, ``eos_input_tp``, ``eos_input_rp``,
  ``eos_input_re``, ``eos_input_ps``, ``eos_input_ph``,
  ``eos_input_th``) and for each of these modes, we compute the error
  in the recovered $T$ and/or $\rho$ (as appropriate).  The full
  thermodynamic state and errors are stored in a plotfile.

* ``test_jac`` :

  for each cell in the data cube, and for a specific network (set via
  ``NETWORK_DIR``) call the analytic Jacobian provided by the network
  and compute the numerical Jacobian (via finite differencing) and
  store the relative difference between each approximation for each
  Jacobian element in a plotfile.

* ``test_neutrino_cooling`` :

  for each cell in the data cube, call the neutrino cooling function
  and store the output in a plotfile.

* ``test_react`` :

  for each cell in the data cube, call the reaction network and
  integrate to a specified time.  Statistics about the number of RHS
  calls are reported at the end.  A lot of options can be set via the
  inputs file to control the integration.

* ``test_rhs`` :

  for each cell in the data cube, call the network's righthand side and
  Jacobian functions and store the output in a plotfile.  The network
  is controlled by the ``NETWORK_DIR`` variable.

* ``test_screening_templated`` :

  for any of the templated-C++ networks, this test will loop over all of
  the rates and calculate the screening factor (the screening routine can
  be set via ``SCREEN_METHOD``).  The factors for each cell in the data
  cube are written to a plotfile.

* ``test_sdc`` :

  similar to ``test_react``, except now we exercise the SDC
  integration infrastructure.  The conserved state that is input to
  the burner is chosen to have a Mach number of $0.1$ (and otherwise
  use the thermodynamics from the data cube).  No advective terms are
  modeled.


One-zone tests
==============

* ``burn_cell`` :

  given a $\rho$, $T$, and $X_k$, integrate a reaction network through a specified time
  and output the new state.

* ``burn_cell_primordial_chem`` :

  similar to ``burn_cell`` except specific for the primordial chemistry network.

* ``burn_cell_sdc`` :

  similar to ``burn_cell`` except this uses the SDC integration code paths.

* ``eos_cell`` :

  given a $\rho$, $T$, and $X_k$, call the equation of state and print out
  the thermodynamic information.

* ``nse_table_cell`` :

  given a $\rho$, $T$, and $Y_e$, evaluate the NSE state via table interpolation
  and print it out.

* ``test_ase`` :

  for the self-consistent NSE, take a $\rho$, $T$, and $Y_e$, and solve for the NSE
  state.  Then check the NSE condition to see if we are actually satisfying the NSE
  criteria for the network.

* ``test_part_func``

  exercise the partition function interpolation for a few select nuclei.


Infrastructure tests
====================

* ``test_linear_algebra`` :

  create a diagonally dominant matrix, multiply it by a test vector, $x$,
  to get $b = Ax$, and then call the linear algebra routines to see if we
  we recover $x$ from $b$.

* ``test_nse_interp`` :

  run various tests of the NSE interpolation routines.

* ``test_parameters`` :

  a simple setup that initializes the runtime parameters and can be
  used to test if we can override them at runtime via inputs or the
  commandline.  This uses both the global data and the struct form
  of the runtime parameters.

* ``test_sdc_vode_rhs`` :

  a simple driver for the SDC RHS routines.  Given a thermodynamic
  state, it outputs the RHS that the integrator will see.
