Comprehensive Unit Tests
========================

There are a few unit tests in Microphysics that operate on a generic
EOS, reaction network, conductivity, or some smaller component to
Microphysics.  Many of these tests exercise the main interfaces in
``Microphysics/interfaces/`` and the code that those call.

These tests compile using the AMReX build system, which assumes that
main is in C++, so each have a ``main.cpp`` driver.  The files
``Microphysics/Make.Microphysics`` and
``Microphysics/Make.Microphysics_extern`` provide the macros necessary
to build the executable. Runtime parameters are parsed in the same
fashion as in the application codes, using the ``write_probin.py``
script.

.. note::

   Most of these tests are written such that the exercise both the C++
   and Fortran implementations of the Microphysics, via the ``do_cxx``
   runtime parameter.

   Most of these tests work with MPI+OpenMP and CUDA


EOS test
--------

``Microphysics/unit_test/test_eos/`` is a unit test for the equations
of state in Microphysics. It sets up a cube of data, with
:math:`\rho`, :math:`T`, and :math:`X_k` varying along the three
dimensions, and then calls the EOS in each zone. Calls are done to
exercise all modes of calling the EOS, in order:

- ``eos_input_rt``: We call the EOS using :math:`\rho, T`. this is the
  reference call, and we save the :math:`h`, :math:`e`, :math:`p`, and
  :math:`s` from here to use in subsequent calls.

- ``eos_input_rh``: We call the EOS using :math:`\rho, h`, to recover
  the original :math:`T`. To give the root finder some work to do, we
  perturb the initial temperature.

  We store the relative error in :math:`T` in the output file.

- ``eos_input_tp``: We call the EOS using :math:`T, p`, to recover the
  original :math:`\rho`. To give the root finder some work to do, we
  perturb the initial density.

  We store the relative error in :math:`\rho` in the output file.

- ``eos_input_rp``: We call the EOS using :math:`\rho, p`, to recover
  the original :math:`T`. To give the root finder some work to do, we
  perturb the initial temperature.

  We store the relative error in :math:`T` in the output file.

- ``eos_input_re``: We call the EOS using :math:`\rho, e`, to recover
  the original :math:`T`. To give the root finder some work to do, we
  perturb the initial temperature.

  We store the relative error in :math:`T` in the output file.

- ``eos_input_ps``: We call the EOS using :math:`p, s`, to recover the
  original :math:`\rho, T`. To give the root finder some work to do,
  we perturb the initial density and temperature.

  Note: entropy is not well-defined for some EOSs, so we only attempt
  the root find if :math:`s > 0`.

  We store the relative error in :math:`\rho, T` in the output file.

- ``eos_input_ph``: We call the EOS using :math:`p, h`, to recover the
  original :math:`\rho, T`. To give the root finder some work to do,
  we perturb the initial density and temperature.

  We store the relative error in :math:`\rho, T` in the output file.

- ``eos_input_th``: We call the EOS using :math:`T, h`, to recover the
  original :math:`\rho`. To give the root finder some work to do, we
  perturb the initial density.

  Note: for some EOSs, :math:`h = h(\rho)` (e.g., an ideal gas), so there
  is no temperature dependence, and we do not do this test.

  We store the relative error in :math:`\rho` in the output file.

This unit test is marked up with OpenMP directives and therefore also
tests whether the EOS is threadsafe.

To compile for a specific EOS, e.g., helmholtz, do::

    make EOS_DIR=helmholtz -j 4

Examining the output (an AMReX plotfile) will show you how big the
errors are. You can use the ``amrex/Tools/Plotfile/`` tool
``fextrema`` to display the maximum error for each variable.

To switch between testing the Fortran and C++ implementations of the EOS,
use ``do_cxx``, e.g., to use the C++ implementation, you would run as::

    ./main3d.gnu.ex inputs_eos do_cxx=1


Network test
------------

``Microphysics/unit_test/test_react/`` is a unit test for the nuclear
reaction networks in Microphysics. It sets up a cube of data, with
:math:`\rho`, :math:`T`, and :math:`X_k` varying along the three
dimensions (as a :math:`16^3` domain), and then calls the EOS in each
zone.  This test does the entire ODE integration of the network for
each zone.

The state in each zone of our data cube is determined by the runtime
parameters ``dens_min``, ``dens_max``, ``temp_min``, and ``temp_max``
for :math:`(\rho, T)`. Because each network carries different
compositions, we specify the composition through runtime parameters in
the ``&extern`` namelist: ``primary_species_1``,
``primary_species_2``, ``primary_species_3``. These primary species
will vary from X = 0.2 to X = 0.7 to 0.9 (depending on the number).
Only one primary species varies at a time. The non-primary species
will be set equally to share whatever fraction of 1 is not accounted
for by the primary species mass fractions.

This test calls the network on each zone, running for a time
``tmax``. The full state, including new mass fractions and energy
release is output to a AMReX plotfile.

You can compile for a specific integrator (e.g., ``VODE``) or
network (e.g., ``aprox13``) as::

    make NETWORK_DIR=aprox13 INTEGRATOR_DIR=VODE -j 4

The loop over the burner is marked up for OpenMP and CUDA and
therefore this test can be used to assess threadsafety of the burners
as well as to optimize the GPU performance of the burners.

This works for both the Fortran and C++ implementations (via ``do_cxx``).


Aprox Rates Test
----------------

``Microphysics/unit_test/test_aprox_rates`` just evaluates the
instantaneous reaction rates in ``Microphysics/rates/`` used by the
``iso7``, ``aprox13``, ``aprox19``, and ``aprox21`` reaction networks.
This uses the same basic ideas as the tests above---a cube of data is
setup and the rates are evaluated using each zone's thermodynamic
conditions.  This test is not really network specific---it tests all
of the available rates.

This works for both the Fortran and C++ implementations (via ``do_cxx``).


Screening Test
--------------

``Microphysics/unit_test/test_screening`` just evaluates the screening
routine, using the ``aprox21`` reaction network.
This uses the same basic ideas as the tests above---a cube of data is
setup and the rates are evaluated using each zone's thermodynamic
conditions. 

This works for both the Fortran and C++ implementations (via ``do_cxx``).


``burn_cell``
=============

``burn_cell`` is a simple one-zone burn that will evolve a state with
a network for a specified amount of time.  This can be used to
understand the timescales involved in a reaction sequence or to
determine the needed ODE tolerances.


Getting Started
---------------

The ``burn_cell`` code are located in
``Microphysics/unit_test/burn_cell``. To run a simulation, ensure that
both an input file and an initial conditions file have been created
and are in the same directory as the executable.

Input File
----------

These files are typically named as ``inputs_burn_network`` where network
is the network you wish to use for your testing.

The structure of this file is is fairly self-explanatory.  The run
prefix defined should be unique to the tests that will be run as they
will be used to identify all of the output files. Typically, the run
prefix involves the name of the network being tested.  The ``atol``
variables define absolute tolerances of the ordinary differential
equations and the ``rtol`` variables define the relative tolerances.  The
second section of the input file collects the inputs that ``main.f90``
asks for so that the user does not have to input all 5+
parameters that are required everytime the test is run.  Each input
required is defined and initialized on the lines following
``&cellparams``.  The use of the parameters is show below:

.. table:: The definition of parameters used in the burn_cell unit tests and specified in the second half of each inputs file.

   +-----------------------+----------------------------------------+
   | ``tmax``              | Maximum Time (s)                       |
   +-----------------------+----------------------------------------+
   | ``numsteps``          | Number of time subdivisions            |
   +-----------------------+----------------------------------------+
   | ``density``           | State Density (:math:`\frac{g}{cm^3}`) |
   +-----------------------+----------------------------------------+
   | ``temperature``       | State Temperature (K)                  |
   +-----------------------+----------------------------------------+
   | ``massfractions(i)``  | Mass Fraction for element i            |
   +-----------------------+----------------------------------------+

Running the Code
----------------

To run the code, enter the burn_cell directory and run::

   ./main.Linux.gfortran.exe with inputs

where ``inputs`` is the name of your inputs file.

For each of the ``numsteps`` steps defined in the inputs
file, the code will output a files into a new directory titled
``run_prefix_output`` where ``run_prefix`` is the run prefix defined in the
inputs file.  Each output file will be named using the run prefix
defined in the inputs file and the corresponding timestep.

Next, run ``burn_cell.py`` using python 3.x, giving the defined run prefix as an argument.
For example::

    python3 burn_cell.py react_aprox13

The ``burn_cell.py`` code will gather information from all of the
output files and compile them into three graphs explained below.

Graphs Output by ``burn_cell.py``
---------------------------------

The file ``run-prefix_logX.png`` and ``run-prefix_logX.eps`` will display a
graph of the chemical abundances as a function of the time, both on
logarithmic scales, for all species involved in the simulation.  An
example of this graph is shown below.

.. figure:: react_aprox13_logX.png

   :width: 4.5in

   logX output cooresponding to the network aprox13.



The file ``run-prefix_ydot.png`` and ``run-prefix_ydot.eps`` will display the
molar fraction (mass fraction / atomic weight) as a function of time,
both on logarithmic scales, for all species involved in the code.

The file ``run-prefix_T-edot.png`` and ``run-prefix_T-edot.eps`` will display
the temperature and the energy generation rate as a function of time.
