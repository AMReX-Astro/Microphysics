The following burners were tested with OpenMP and found to be
threadsafe:

ignition_chamulak
rprox
triple_alpha_plus_cago


The following burners should be threadsafe, but were not tested with
OpenMP:

ignition_simple


A good way to test the threadsafe-ness of a burner is to run the
MAESTRO/Exec/UNIT_TESTS/test_react problem with OpenMP with 1 thread
and multiple threads and compare the output using fcompare.
