Routines to incorporate the MESA network into MAESTRO

Routines include:
	burner.f90
	burn_solout.f90
	Do_One_Zone_Burn.f90
	get_mesa_ebin.f90
	net_utils.f90
	setup_mesa_net.f90
	shutdown_mesa_net.f90

Support Files & Dirs:
	GPackage.mak
	NETWORK_REQUIRES
	network.template.mesa
	write_network.py
	Net-Files/
	scripts/

ROUTINES:
-----------
-burner.f90 is the standard MAESTRO interface that calls the MESA network

-Do_One_Zone_Burn is an interface to the MESA one zone burner 

-burn_solout is called after each step of the burn. This subroutine is 
	responsible for calculating the energy generation rate (borrowed 
	from MESA source code with very little modification)

-net_utils is a module that holds a variables used by MESA routines

-setup_mesa_net is the setup routine that initializes the MESA network

-shutdown_mesa_net shuts down the network

-get_mesa_ebin.g90 returns binding energy using MESA values

SUPPORT FILES:
----------------
Net-Files is a directory which includes net files with lists of isotopes 
	and their properties to be used in the network. These net files 
	are read by the write_network.py script at compile time to create 
	the network.f90 module

write_network.py uses network.template.mesa and an input net file to 
	generate the network.f90 file which includes the setup_mesa_net 
	and shutdown_mesa_net subroutine calls and defining of MESA 
	related variables

network.template.mesa is the network.f90 template used by write_network.py

NETWORK_REQUIRES is an empty file telling MAESTRO that there are no extra 
	requirements for the MESA network

GPackage.mak is the makefile that defines which routines to add to the f90 
	sources	list, which directories to include, what libraries to link 
	and the rules needed to generate the network.f90 module

scripts is a directory that holds useful scripts for compiling either one 
	or all of the MESA modules
