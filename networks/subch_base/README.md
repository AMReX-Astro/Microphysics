# subch_base

This network is a further simplification of subch_simple by
excluding N14, F18, Ne21, and Na22.
These nuclei were added to include n14(a, g)f18(a, p)ne21 rate sequence,
which allows an enhancement to the c12(p, g)n13(a, p)o16 rate due to the
proton release. However, we find that the effect is not very significant,
and they also caused an artificial endpoint at Na22.
