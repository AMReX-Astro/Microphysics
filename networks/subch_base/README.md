# subch_base

This is the base of all subch networks. In addition to all the simplifications
done in subch_simple, this network also excluded N14, F18, Ne21, and Na22.
These nuclei were added to include n14(a, g)f18(a, p)ne21 rate sequence,
which allows an enhancement to the c12(p, g)n13(a, p)o16 rate due to the
proton release. However, we find that the effect is not very significant,
and can be approximated out.
