# our reaction rate has the form
#
# r = r_0 n_f^2 (T/T_0)^2     [this has units of cm^3/s]
#
# and then the energy generation rate is 
#
# eps = rQ/rho                [this has units of erg/g/s]
#
# But written in terms of mass fractions, it is 


# the coefficient for the reaction rate
r0            real    1.d0    

# exponent for the temperature
nu            real    4.d0

# reaction specific q-value (in erg/g)
specific_q_burn        real   10.d0

# reaction thresholds (for the power law)
T_burn_ref    real   1.0d0
