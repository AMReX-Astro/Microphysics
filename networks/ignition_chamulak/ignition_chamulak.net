# The ignition network is used for wdconvect with the ignition_chamulak burner.

# the ash from C12 burning according to Chamulak et al. is a mixture
# of C13, O16, Ne20, and Na23.   Ne20 + alpha results 60% of the time,
# while Na23 + p is the other 40%.   Fusing 6 C12 will result in
# 1.2 Na23, 1.2 O16 (from the alpha), 1.8 Ne20, and 1.8 C13.
# The ash state will have an A and Z corresponding to this mixture.
