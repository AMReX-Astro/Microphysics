The following networks are actively maintained and should work
in CASTRO:

- iso7
- aprox13
- aprox19
- aprox21
- powerlaw
- ignition_simple
- rprox

Other networks should be considered experimental and/or
have not yet had their interfaces updated from
earlier versions of the code; they likely do not work.

Note that at present MAESTRO is incompatible with all
networks here but we are planning to rectify that in
a future release.
