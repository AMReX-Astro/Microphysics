This is a rewrite of Frank Timmes' aprox13 network.  The aprox13.tbz
was downloaded from his website on 2013-03-18.  We want to make it 
(1) threadsafe, (2) use VODE, and (3) work with an SDC methodology.

This version integrates the 13 species equations, a temperature equation
(to get the temperature for rate evaluations), and an enuc equation
(to accumulate the amount of energy generated over the step)


We mainly need from his package the following:

  -- RHS routines

  -- screening routines

  -- plasma neutrino loss routines

  -- final energy generation routine


We will use a numerical Jacobian with VODE to make things easier.

In particular, the following routines from the original package 
are not used:

  -- screen6 (never seems to have been called.  screen5 is used instead)

  -- snupp, snucno -- these are neutrino loss routines for H burning -- we
     are not modeling that

 -- netint and all of the ma28 stuff -- we are using VODE

 -- ecapnuc*, mazurek -- no electron captures

 -- *wien*

 -- most of the rate_* routines -- we only need the ones specific to this
    network


Modifications:

 -- we made a derived type call tf_t that holds all the various
    temperature factors.  This way we can eliminate those common
    blocks.

 -- screen5 seems to cache the old temperature information to allow it
    to save on recomputing the plasma factors.  This is not
    threadsafe.

    Screening also has init=1 initially and precomputes all of the
    expensive factors the first time through and then stores these
    on subsequent calls.  This could be moved to an initialization
    routine where these are stored in a threadsafe module variable



other changes:

 -- since we are not using the analytic Jacobian, we can get rid of
    all of those drate... stuff.
