# subch_simple

This is a further approximation of the subch_full network.  In
addition to removing the same 6 nuclei as subch_approx (by doing an
(a,p)(p,g) approximation), it also removes

* The reverse of C12+C12, C12+O16, and O16+O16 -- these reverse rates
  are not in aprox13

* The C12+Ne20 rates and their reverses

* (a,g) links between Na23 and Al27 and between Al27 and P31 -- these
  are not in aprox13
