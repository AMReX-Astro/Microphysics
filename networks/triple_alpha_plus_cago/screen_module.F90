! This module contains the screen routine which applies screening corrections
! to the reaction rates.  The input composition must be in terms of molar
! fractions.  The triple-alpha reaction goes through a compound nucleus
! channel and therefore screening must be applied to both reactions.
!
! A call is made to screen5 which lives in screen.f to apply the screening
! to a single reaction.
