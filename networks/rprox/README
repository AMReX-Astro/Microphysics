This is an approximate network for rp-process burning.  It is
essentially the network described in Appendix C of Wallace & Woosley,
ApJS 45, 389 (1981) but with updated reaction rates from ReacLib.

The default setup is for burning in a neutron star atmosphere.  If you
want a setup at lower density, you need to change the Lweak paramter
in f_rhs.f90.
