# He-C-Fe-group

This is a network for He and C burning with a heavy emphasis on iron
group.  It has the same basic structure as ``subch_approx`` for the
main alpha-chain.  At high mass number, a lot of nuclei in the iron
group are added and weak rates from the Langanke tables are used to
link them.  Neutrons are only present in the links in the iron group.
