# aprox19

This is a rewrite of Frank Timmes' aprox19 network, based on aprox19.tbz
as downloaded from his website on 2015-12-31. It follows the same reasoning
as the aprox13 network in this repository, so see the README in that directory
for information on our integration strategy. This directory is a copy of the
files in the aprox13/ directory, with appropriate changes for the number of
species and reaction rates.

We thank Frank for allowing us to redistribute these routines.

We can use the tabulated NSE together with this network.

----

Note: there are 2 protons in this network.

* `H1` is hydrogen that participates in the p-p chain and CNO cycle

* `p` are protons that result from photodisintegration and participate
  in the NSE at the Fe-group
