Welcome to the \microphysics\ User's Guide!

In this User's Guide we describe the microphysics modules designed to
support \boxlib\ codes such as \castro\ and \maestro. These all have a
consistent interface and are designed to provide the users of those
codes an easy experience in moving from the barebones microphysics
modules provided in those codes. For the purposes of this user's
guide, the microphysical components we currently deal with are the
equation of state (EOS) and the nuclear burning network.

\microphysics\ is not a stand-alone code. It is intended to be used in
conjuction with \boxlib\ codes and so we do not provide support for
running these codes separately.  However, in many cases we will
provide test modules that demonstrate a minimal working example for
how to run the modules.

A number of the routines contained here we authored by other people.
We bundle them here with permission, usually changing the interfaces
to be compatible with our standardized interface.  We in particular
thank Frank Timmes for numerous reaction networks and his equation
of state routines.
