\section{Introduction}

SDC provides a means to more strongly couple the reactions to the
hydrodynamics by evolving the reactions together with an approximation
of the advection over the timestep.

\section{Interface and Data Structures}

\subsection{\tt sdc\_t}

To accommodate the increased information required to evolve the
coupled system, we introduce a new data type, {\tt sdc\_t}.  This is
used to pass information to/from the integration routine from the
hydrodynamics code.
