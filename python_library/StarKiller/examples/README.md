# Examples

This is a work in progress, at present there are two examples that
work. Other examples that work with an older API may not work.

## Calling the EOS

`call_eos.py` is a driver script that calls the EOS given inputs of
density, temperature, and composition.

## Integrating a reaction network

`Burn-Subch.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that integrates the subch
network and generates plots of mass fractions, energy generation, and
temperature.
