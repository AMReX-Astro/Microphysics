-- in VODE, we don't initialize the internal energy to the zone
   energy, but instead set it to 0.0

-- VODE has a minimum timestep of 0.0

-- VODE does a modified-Newton (chord) iteration for the solve does
   -- VBDF do that?

-- is the convergence check the same in VODE and VBDF?

-- VBDF does caching of the Jacobian
