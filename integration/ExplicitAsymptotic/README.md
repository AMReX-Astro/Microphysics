An explicit integrator using the asymptotic approximation proposed by
M. Guidry et al. in Computational Science & Discovery 6 (2013) 015001,
"Explicit integration of extremely stiff reaction networks: asymptotic methods."
The timestepping is determined by not letting any integration
quantity change by more than a given factor in a timestep.
