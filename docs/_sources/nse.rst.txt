NSE
***

The reaction networks in Microphysics have the ability to use NSE
instead of integrating the entire network when the conditions are
appropriate.  There are 2 different implementations of NSE in
Microphysics, that have slightly different use cases.

* :ref:`tabulated_nse` : this uses a table of NSE abundances given
  :math:`(\rho, T, Y_e)` generate from a large network (125 isotopes).
  The table also returns :math:`dY_e/dt` resulting from
  electron-captures, to allow for the NSE state to evolve.  This is
  meant to be used in the cores of massive stars and works only with the
  ``aprox19`` reaction network.

  Furthermore, since the table can achieve :math:`Y_e` and
  :math:`\bar{A}` that are not representable by the 19 isotopes in
  ``aprox19``, this table requires that we use the auxiliary
  composition and advect :math:`Y_e`, :math:`\bar{A}`, and
  :math:`\langle B/A\rangle`.  All of the EOS calls will work with
  these quantities.

  This is enabled via ``USE_NSE_TABLE``

* :ref:`self_consistent_nse` : this adds an NSE solver to the network that
  can be called to find the equilibrium abundances of each of the
  species defined in the network.  It works with any of the
  pynucastro-generated networks.  Unlike the tabulated NSE, there is
  no need to advect the auxiliary composition, since this only deals
  with the isotopes defined in the main reaction network.

  This is enabled via ``USE_NSE_NET``

Both solvers define a number of preprocessor variables, and both will
provide a function ``in_nse()`` that can be used to determine if a
state is currently in NSE.

=================        ======================================
make option               preprocessor variables set
-----------------        --------------------------------------
``USE_NSE_TABLE``        ``NSE``, ``NSE_TABLE``, ``AUX_THERMO``
``USE_NSE_NET``          ``NSE``, ``NSE_NET``
=================        ======================================

The directive ``NSE`` should be used whether the specific
implementation of NSE does not matter.

These two NSE solvers are described below.


.. _tabulated_nse:

Tabulated NSE and ``aprox19``
=============================

The ``aprox19`` network can be run in a manner where we blends the
standard ``aprox19`` network with a table for nuclear statistic
equilibrium resulting from a much larger network at high density and
temperatures.    This option is enabled by building with:

.. prompt:: bash

   NETWORK_DIR=aprox19 USE_NSE_TABLE=TRUE

Composition and EOS
-------------------

The NSE table was generated using a 125 nuclei reaction network
(described in :cite:`ma:2013`), and includes electron-capture rates,
so the compositional quantities it carries, :math:`\bar{A}` and
:math:`Y_e` and not representable from the 19 isotopes we carry in the
network.  In particular, it can attain a lower :math:`Y_e` than
``aprox19`` can represent.

For this reason, when we are using the NSE network, we always take the
composition quantities in the EOS directly from ``eos_state.aux[]``
instead of from ``eos_state.xn[]``.  The ``AUX_THERMO`` preprocessor
variable is enabled in this case, and the equations of state interpret
this to use the auxiliary data for the composition.  This is described in :ref:`aux_eos_comp`.


NSE Table Outputs
-----------------

The NSE table provides values for the auxiliary composition,
:math:`Y_e`, :math:`\bar{A}`, and :math:`\langle B/A \rangle`
resulting from the full 125 nuclei network.   It also provides a set of 19
:math:`X_k` that map into the isotopes carried by ``aprox19``.


These three quantities are stored as ``aux`` data in the network and
are indexed as ``iye``, ``iabar``, and ``ibea``.  Additionally, when
coupling to hydrodynamics, we need to advect these auxiliary
quantities.

For Strang split coupling of hydro and reactions, :math:`DX_k/Dt = 0`,
and our evolution equations are:

.. math::

   \begin{align*}
   \frac{DY_e}{Dt} &= \sum_k \frac{Z_k}{A_k} \frac{DX_k}{Dt} = 0 \\
   \frac{D}{Dt} \frac{1}{\bar{A}} &= - \frac{1}{\bar{A}^2} \frac{D\bar{A}}{Dt} = \sum_k \frac{1}{A_k} \frac{DX_k}{Dt} = 0 \rightarrow \frac{D\bar{A}}{Dt} = 0 \\
   \frac{D}{Dt} \left (\frac{B}{A} \right ) &= \sum_k \frac{B_k}{A_k} \frac{DX_k}{Dt} = 0
   \end{align*}

Therefore each of these auxiliary equations obeys an advection equation
in the hydro part of the advancement.


NSE Flow
--------

The basic flow of a simulation using ``aprox19`` + the NSE table is as follows:

* initialize the problem, including :math:`X_k`

* fill the initial aux data with :math:`Y_e`, :math:`\bar{A}`, and :math:`(B/A)`

* in hydro, we will update these quantities simply via advection (for
  Strang-split evolution)

* for the reactive update:

  * check if NSE applies (see below)

  * if we are in an NSE region:

    * use :math:`\rho`, :math:`T`, and :math:`Y_e` to call the table.
      This returns: :math:`dY_e/dt`, :math:`(B/A)_{\rm out}`, and :math:`\bar{A}_{\rm out}`.

    * update :math:`Y_e` [#fY]_ :

      .. math::

         (Y_e)_{\rm out} = (Y_e)_{\rm in} + \Delta t \frac{dY_e}{dt}

    * :math:`\bar{A}_{\rm out}` is simply the value returned from the table

    * the energy generation rate, :math:`e_{\rm nuc}` is:

      .. math::

         e_{\rm nuc} = \eta \left [ \left ( \frac{B}{A} \right )_{\rm out} -
                                    \left ( \frac{B}{A} \right )_{\rm in} \right ] * \frac{1.602 \times 10^{-6}  {\rm erg}}{{\rm MeV}} N_A \frac{1}{\Delta t}


      where :math:`\eta` is an inertia term < 1 to prevent the energy changing too much in one set.

    * the new binding energy for the zone is then:

      .. math::

         \left ( \frac{B}{A} \right )_{\rm out}  = \left ( \frac{B}{A} \right )_{\rm in} + \eta \left [ \left ( \frac{B}{A} \right )_{\rm out} - \left ( \frac{B}{A} \right )_{\rm in} \right ]

    * update the mass fractions, :math:`X_k`, using the values from the table

  * if we are not in NSE:

    * integrate the ``aprox19`` network as usual

    * update the aux quantities at the end of the burn


NSE check
---------

We determine is a zone is in NSE according to:

* :math:`\rho` > ``rho_nse``

* :math:`T` > ``T_nse``

* :math:`X(\isotm{C}{12})` < ``C_nse``

* :math:`X(\isotm{He}{4}) + X(\isotm{Cr}{48}) + X(\isotm{Fe}{52}) + X(\isotm{Fe}{54}) + X(\isotm{Ni}{56})` > ``He_Fe_nse``

.. _self_consistent_nse:


NSE table ranges
----------------

The NSE table was created for:

* :math:`9 < \log_{10}(T) < 10.4`
* :math:`7 < \log_{10}(\rho) < 10`
* :math:`0.4 < Y_e < 0.5`



Self-consistent NSE
===================

The self-consistent NSE approach uses only the nuclei in the main
reaction network.  It solves for the chemical potentials of the proton
and neutron and from there gets the abundances of each of the nuclei
under the assumption of NSE, following the procedure outlined in :cite:`Calder_2007`.

The solve is done using a port of the hybrid Powell method from
MINPACK (we ported the solver to templated C++).

The advantage of this approach is that it can be used with any
reaction network, once the integration has reached NSE.

This solver is enabled by compiling with

.. prompt:: bash

   USE_NSE_NET=TRUE

The functions to find the NSE state are then found in ``nse_solver.H``.

Dynamic NSE Check
-----------------

We have implemented a dynamic NSE check for the self-consistent nse procedure
that tells us whether the network has reached the NSE state. The overall procedure
is outlined in :cite:`Kushnir_2020`. The overall usage comes down to a single function
``in_nse(state)``. By supplying the current state, this function returns a boolean that
tells us whether we're in NSE or not. The current status of this functionality only
works for pynucastro-generated network since aprox networks have slightly different syntax.
Note that we ignore this check when ``T < 2.0e9``, since we don't expect NSE to occur when
temperature is below 2 billion Kelvin.

There are 3 main criteria discussed in the :cite:`Kushnir_2020`.

* Have a rough check to determine whether the current state is close to NSE. They use a
  criteria of:

  .. math::

     \frac{r - r_{NSE}}{r_{NSE}} < 0.5

  where :math:`r = Y_\alpha/(Y_p^2 Y_n^2)` and
  :math:`r_{NSE} = \left(Y_\alpha/(Y_p^2 Y_n^2)\right)_{NSE}`.

* Does the network has a fast reaction cycle that exchanges 1 :math:`\alpha` particle with
  2 :math:`p` and 2 :math:`n` particles. This cycle should have the following reactions or
  their reverse:

  * 1 :math:`(\alpha, \gamma)`, 2 :math:`(\gamma, p)`, 2 :math:`(\gamma, n)`
  * 1 :math:`(\alpha, p)`, 1 :math:`(\gamma, p)`, 2 :math:`(\gamma, n)`
  * 1 :math:`(\alpha, n)`, 2 :math:`(\gamma, p)`, 1 :math:`(\gamma, n)`

  To consider to be fast reaction cycle, we require every step in the cycle to
  have :math:`Y_i/\textbf{min}(b_f, b_r) < \epsilon t_s` for :math:`i = n, p, \alpha`
  participated in this step, where :math:`b_f` and :math:`b_r`
  are the forward and reverse rate of the reaction, :math:`\epsilon` is a tolerance which
  has a default value of :math:`0.1`, and :math:`t_s` is the sound crossing time of a
  simulation cell. Note: we skip this check when there is no neutron involved in the network.

  An example of such reaction cycle would be:

  .. math::
     
     \isotm{S}{32} (\gamma, p)(\gamma, p)(\gamma, n)(\gamma, n) \isotm{Si}{28}
     (\alpha, \gamma) \isotm{S}{32}

  The general approach to this is to start iterations from the heaviest to the lightest
  nuclei. Then the algorithm checks if isotopes involved in the network can actually form
  a cycle using the combination reactions above. If such cycle is formed, then we check the
  rates of these reactions to see if they satisfy the condition mention previously.
  If there are no isotope present in the network that would form a closed-cycle,
  we move on to the next nuclei. We break out of the iteration once we found
  a fast reaction cycle.
    
* If the previous two check pass, we proceed to nuclei grouping. Initially,
  :math:`p`, :math:`n`, and :math:`\alpha` are grouped into a single group called
  the light-isotope-group, or LIG. Other isotopes belong to their own group,
  which only contains themselves. During each iteration, we find all valid reaction, 
  :math:`k`, that has the fastest time-scale,
  :math:`t_{i,k} = \tilde{Y}_i/\textbf{min}(b_f(k), b_r(k))`, for :math:`i` to be the isotope
  involved with the reaction that is different from :math:`p`, :math:`n`, and :math:`\alpha`.
  :math:`\tilde{Y}_i` represents the sum of molar fractions of the group that isotope :math:`i`
  belongs in, or :math:`\tilde{Y}_i = \Sigma_{l \in q}Y^l_i`. After determining which reaction
  has the fastest time-scale, there are two requirements for us to check whether this reaction
  can be used to group the nuclei involved, which are:

  * at least 1 isotope, :math:`i`, that passes:

    .. math::

       t_{i,k} < \epsilon t_s
       
  *

    .. math::

      2|b_f(k) - b_r(k)|/(b_f(k) + b_r(k) < \epsilon
    
  Here we only consider two cases of reactions:

  * There are exactly two isotopes involved in reaction, :math:`k`, that are not in the
    light-isotope-group. In this case, if the reaction passes the two criteria mentioned above,
    we merge the groups containing those two isotopes if they're not yet in the same group.

  * There is only one isotope involved in reaction, :math:`k`, that is not in the
    light-isotope-group, which is not necessarily isotope :math:`i` that passes the
    first criteria. In this case, we merge the isotope that is not in LIG into LIG.

  Here we skip over reactions of the following due to obvious reasons:

  * Reactions that have no reverse rates.

  * Reactions that involve more than 2 reactants and products

  * Reactions that have more than 2 non-light-isotope-group.
    
  * The nuclei that participate in the reaction is either in LIG or in another group.
    This means that the non-LIG nuclei have already merged.

  And the iteration stops once there are no reactions that can satisfy the above criteria.
  At the end of the iterations, we define that the current state have reached NSE
  when there is only a single group left, or there are two groups left where
  1 of them is the light-isotope-group.

  When there is no neutron in the network, it can be difficult for isotopes to form
  a single group due to the missing neutron rates. Therefore, there is an alternative
  criteria of defining a "single group" when neutron is not present in the network:
  for isotopes, :math:`Z >= 14`, isotopes with odd and even :math:`N` form two
  distinct groups. 
  

Additional Options
------------------

Here we have some runtime options to allow a more cruel estimation to the self-consistent
nse check:

* ``nse.nse_dx_independent = 1`` in the input file allows the nse check to ignore
  the dependency on the cell size, ``dx``, which calculates the sound crossing time, ``t_s``.
  Naturally, we require the timescale of the rates to be smaller than ``t_s`` to ensure the
  states have time to achieve equilibrium. However, sometimes this check can be difficult
  to achieve, so we leave this as an option for the user to explore.

* ``nse.nse_molar_independent = 1`` in the input file allows the user to use the nse mass
  fractions for nse check after the first check (the one that ensures we're close enough
  to the nse mass fractions to get reasonable results) is passed. This allows the subsequent
  checks to only rely on the thermodynamic conditions instead of mass fractions.

* ``nse.nse_skip_molar = 1`` in the input file allows the user to skip the molar fraction
  check after the integration has failed. This option is used to completely forgo the
  requirement on molar fractions and allow the check to only dependent on the thermodynamic
  conditions. By only applying this after option after the integration failure, we hope the
  integrator has evolved the system to the NSE state the best it can. By turning on this
  option, we hope to give relief to the integrator if the system is in NSE thermodynamically,
  which is likely the case.

* ``nse.T_nse_net`` in the input file allows the user to define a simple temperature threshold
  to determine the NSE state instead of using the complicated procedure that looks for a
  balance between the forward and the reverse rates. Once this quantity is set to a positive
  value, then ``in_nse`` returns ``true`` if the current temperature is higher than ``T_nse_net``,
  and ``false`` if the current temperature is lower than ``T_nse_net``.
  Note that we still perform a simple molar fraction check to ensure that the current state
  is close enough to the NSE state.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#fY] The table actually provides the weak rate, which is the sum
   of all electron capture and positron decay rates times the
   appropriate abundances minus a similar rate for the beta decay and
   positron capture, [wrate] = [rectot] + [rpdtot] - [redtot] - [rpctot]

   So if electron capture dominates, then [wrate] is positive and this should
   be subtracted from :math:`Y_e`.
