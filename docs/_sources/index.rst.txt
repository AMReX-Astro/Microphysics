AMReX-Astro Microphysics
************************

AMReX-Astro Microphysics is a collection of microphysics routines (equations of state,
reaction networks, ...) and utilities (ODE integrators, NSE solvers)
for astrophysical simulation codes.

The original design was to support codes based on the `AMReX
<https://github.com/amrex-codes/amrex>`_ adaptive mesh refinement library :cite:`amrex_joss`,
including `CASTRO
<https://github.com/amrex-astro/Castro>`_ :cite:`castro_I`, `MAESTROeX
<https://github.com/amrex-astro/MAESTROeX>`_ :cite:`maestroex`, and, later, Quokka :cite:`quokka`. These all have a
consistent interface and the separate Microphysics repository allows
them to share the same equation of state, reaction networks, and more.

Microphysics is written in C++ as a (mostly) header-only library, making
extensive use of templating and C++ `constexpr` features to be performant
on both CPU and GPU architectures.  It is compatible with both NVIDIA CUDA
and AMD HIP/ROCm.

While there are a number of unit tests that exercise the functionality,
Microphysics is primarily intended to be used along with another simulation
code.   At the moment, the interfaces and
build stubs are compatible with the AMReX codes and use the AMReX build
system.

.. note::

   A number of the routines contained here we authored by other people.
   We bundle them here with permission, usually changing the interfaces
   to be compatible with our standardized interface. We in particular
   thank Frank Timmes for numerous reaction networks and his equation
   of state routines.
