\section{Thermal Conductivity}

Thermal conductivities are provided by the {\tt conductivity/}
directory.  At the moment, there is a single version, {\tt
  stellar}\footnote{this code comes from Frank Timmes' website,
  \url{http://cococubed.asu.edu/code_pages/kap.shtml}} that is useful
for stellar interiors.

{\bf Important: it is assumed that the state is thermodynamically consistent
before calling the conductivity routine.}  It may be necessary to do an EOS
call first, to enforce the consistency.
