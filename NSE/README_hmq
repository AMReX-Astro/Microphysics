This is the code that generates the file hmq_table.txt. The program calculates for a given electron fraction Y_e, 
enthalpy minus nuclear binding energy per gram (hmq), and pressure what the temperature, density, proton and neutron chemical 
potentials are for matter in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) at the same pressure and hmq. Temperature dependent 
nuclear partition functions are used (Rauscher 2000) and coulomb corrections are included using the fitting form from Chabrier & Potekhin 1998. 
The code calls the Helmholtz equation of state (Timmes 1999). 
The solution is found via a 4 dimensional newton-raphson iteration. From the solution the massfractions of nuclei in NSE are derived, 
and from the massfractions the average binding energy per nucleon, the average proton number per nucleus, the average nucleon number 
per nucleus are calculated. Using a rate table for weak interactions (Langanke & Martinez-Pinedo 2001) the neutrino energy losses and the 
instantaneous time rate of change of the electron fraction are calculated.
The program has 3 nested loops. The outer loops over ye, the middle over pressure and the inner loop over hmq. 
The name of the output file is specified in nse.f90. The range and spacing of the table is specified in init_eos.f90. I use logarithmic spacing in
the pressure, and linear spacing for hmq and ye. hmq in init_eos.f90 is in units of 10^18 ergs/g.

 
Below is a description of the columns in the table:

column 1: Electron fraction Ye 
column 2: initial (and final) Pressure [barye]
column 3: initial (and final) hmq [ergs g^{-1}]
column 4: final density [g cm^{-3}]
column 5: final temperature [K]
column 6: final internal energy [ergs g^{-1}]
column 7: final binding energy per nucleon [MeV per nucleon]
column 8: average nucleon number per nucleus
column 9: average proton number per nucleus
column10: neutrino and anti-neutrino loss rates [ergs g^{-1}]
column11: rate of change of electron fraction [s^{-1}]
column12: %error in pressure (pres_i-pres_f)/pres_i --> measure of accuracy of solution
column13: integer number of newton-loops started (not iteration per loop) --> measure of quality of inital guess and easy of convergence

This are the first three lines of the table:

The program was designed under time constraints and I am aware that is does not exhibit good programming form and style. If you have any questions,
try to find me and I'll see if I can help.
