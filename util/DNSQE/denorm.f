C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Given an N-vector X, this function calculates the
C     Euclidean norm of X.
C
C     The Euclidean norm is computed by accumulating the sum of
C     squares in three different sums. The sums of squares for the
C     small and large components are scaled so that no overflows
C     occur. Non-destructive underflows are permitted. Underflows
C     and overflows do not occur in the computation of the unscaled
C     sum of squares for the intermediate components.
C     The definitions of small, intermediate and large components
C     depend on two constants, RDWARF and RGIANT. The main
C     restrictions on these constants are that RDWARF**2 not
C     underflow and RGIANT**2 not overflow. The constants
C     given here are suitable for every known computer.
C
C     The function statement is

C
C       N is a positive integer input variable.
