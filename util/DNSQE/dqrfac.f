C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   **** Double Precision version of QRFAC ****
C
C     This subroutine uses Householder transformations with column
C     pivoting (optional) to compute a QR factorization of the
C     M by N matrix A. That is, DQRFAC determines an orthogonal
C     matrix Q, a permutation matrix P, and an upper trapezoidal
C     matrix R with diagonal elements of nonincreasing magnitude,
C     such that A*P = Q*R. The Householder transformation for
C     column K, K = 1,2,...,MIN(M,N), is of the form
C
C                           T
C           I - (1/U(K))*U*U
C
C     where U has zeros in the first K-1 positions. The form of
C     this transformation and the method of pivoting first
C     appeared in the corresponding LINPACK subroutine.
C
C     The subroutine statement is
C
C       SUBROUTINE DQRFAC(M,N,A,LDA,PIVOT,IPVT,LIPVT,SIGMA,ACNORM,WA)
C
C     where
C
C       M is a positive integer input variable set to the number
C         of rows of A.
C
C       N is a positive integer input variable set to the number
C         of columns of A.
C
C       A is an M by N array. On input A contains the matrix for
C         which the QR factorization is to be computed. On output
C         the strict upper trapezoidal part of A contains the strict
C         upper trapezoidal part of R, and the lower trapezoidal
C         part of A contains a factored form of Q (the non-trivial
C         elements of the U vectors described above).
C
C       LDA is a positive integer input variable not less than M
C         which specifies the leading dimension of the array A.
C
C       PIVOT is a logical input variable. If pivot is set .TRUE.,
C         then column pivoting is enforced. If pivot is set .FALSE.,
C         then no column pivoting is done.
C
C       IPVT is an integer output array of length LIPVT. IPVT
C         defines the permutation matrix P such that A*P = Q*R.
C         Column J of P is column IPVT(J) of the identity matrix.
C         If pivot is .FALSE., IPVT is not referenced.
C
C       LIPVT is a positive integer input variable. If PIVOT is
C             .FALSE., then LIPVT may be as small as 1. If PIVOT is
C             .TRUE., then LIPVT must be at least N.
C
C       SIGMA is an output array of length N which contains the
C         diagonal elements of R.
C
C       ACNORM is an output array of length N which contains the
C         norms of the corresponding columns of the input matrix A.
C         If this information is not needed, then ACNORM can coincide
C         with SIGMA.
C
C       WA is a work array of length N. If pivot is .FALSE., then WA
C         can coincide with SIGMA.
