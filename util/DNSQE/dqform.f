C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This subroutine proceeds from the computed QR factorization of
C     an M by N matrix A to accumulate the M by M orthogonal matrix
C     Q from its factored form.
C
C     The subroutine statement is
C
C       SUBROUTINE DQFORM(M,N,Q,LDQ,WA)
C
C     where
C
C       M is a positive integer input variable set to the number
C         of rows of A and the order of Q.
C
C       N is a positive integer input variable set to the number
C         of columns of A.
C
C       Q is an M by M array. On input the full lower trapezoid in
C         the first MIN(M,N) columns of Q contains the factored form.
C         On output Q has been accumulated into a square matrix.
C
C       LDQ is a positive integer input variable not less than M
C         which specifies the leading dimension of the array Q.
C
C       WA is a work array of length M.
