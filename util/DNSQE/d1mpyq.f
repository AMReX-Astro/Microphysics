C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  D1MPYQ
C***SUBSIDIARY

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Given an M by N matrix A, this subroutine computes A*Q where
C     Q is the product of 2*(N - 1) transformations
C
C           GV(N-1)*...*GV(1)*GW(1)*...*GW(N-1)
C
C     and GV(I), GW(I) are Givens rotations in the (I,N) plane which
C     eliminate elements in the I-th and N-th planes, respectively.
C     Q itself is not given, rather the information to recover the
C     GV, GW rotations is supplied.
C
C     The SUBROUTINE statement is
C
C       SUBROUTINE D1MPYQ(M,N,A,LDA,V,W)
C
C     where
C
C       M is a positive integer input variable set to the number
C         of rows of A.
C
C       N IS a positive integer input variable set to the number
C         of columns of A.
C
C       A is an M by N array. On input A must contain the matrix
C         to be postmultiplied by the orthogonal matrix Q
C         described above. On output A*Q has replaced A.
C
C       LDA is a positive integer input variable not less than M
C         which specifies the leading dimension of the array A.
C
C       V is an input array of length N. V(I) must contain the
C         information necessary to recover the Givens rotation GV(I)
C         described above.
C
C       W is an input array of length N. W(I) must contain the
C         information necessary to recover the Givens rotation GW(I)
C         described above.
