C***DESCRIPTION
C
C 1. Purpose.
C
C       The purpose of DNSQE is to find a zero of a system of N
C       nonlinear functions in N variables by a modification of the
C       Powell hybrid method.  This is done by using the more general
C       nonlinear equation solver DNSQ.  The user must provide a
C       subroutine which calculates the functions.  The user has the
C       option of either to provide a subroutine which calculates the
C       Jacobian or to let the code calculate it by a forward-difference
C       approximation.  This code is the combination of the MINPACK
C       codes (Argonne) HYBRD1 and HYBRJ1.
C
C 2. Subroutine and Type Statements.
C
C       SUBROUTINE DNSQE(FCN,JAC,IOPT,N,X,FVEC,TOL,NPRINT,INFO,
C      *                  WA,LWA)
C       INTEGER IOPT,N,NPRINT,INFO,LWA
C       DOUBLE PRECISION TOL
C       DOUBLE PRECISION X(N),FVEC(N),WA(LWA)
C       EXTERNAL FCN,JAC
C
C 3. Parameters.
C
C       Parameters designated as input parameters must be specified on
C       entry to DNSQE and are not changed on exit, while parameters
C       designated as output parameters need not be specified on entry
C       and are set to appropriate values on exit from DNSQE.
C
C       FCN is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which calculates
C         the functions.  FCN must be declared in an external statement
C         in the user calling program, and should be written as follows.
C
C         SUBROUTINE FCN(N,X,FVEC,IFLAG)
C         INTEGER N,IFLAG
C         DOUBLE PRECISION X(N),FVEC(N)
C         ----------
C         Calculate the functions at X and
C         return this vector in FVEC.
C         ----------
C         RETURN
C         END
C
C         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by FCN unless the
C         user wants to terminate execution of DNSQE.  In this case set
C         IFLAG to a negative integer.
C
C       JAC is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which calculates
C         the Jacobian.  If IOPT=1, then JAC must be declared in an
C         external statement in the user calling program, and should be
C         written as follows.
C
C         SUBROUTINE JAC(N,X,FVEC,FJAC,LDFJAC,IFLAG)
C         INTEGER N,LDFJAC,IFLAG
C         DOUBLE PRECISION X(N),FVEC(N),FJAC(LDFJAC,N)
C         ----------
C         Calculate the Jacobian at X and return this
C         matrix in FJAC.  FVEC contains the function
C         values at X and should not be altered.
C         ----------
C         RETURN
C         END
C
C         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by JAC unless the
C         user wants to terminate execution of DNSQE. In this case set
C         IFLAG to a negative integer.
C
C         If IOPT=2, JAC can be ignored (treat it as a dummy argument).
C
C       IOPT is an input variable which specifies how the Jacobian will
C         be calculated.  If IOPT=1, then the user must supply the
C         Jacobian through the subroutine JAC.  If IOPT=2, then the
C         code will approximate the Jacobian by forward-differencing.
C
C       N is a positive integer input variable set to the number of
C         functions and variables.
C
C       X is an array of length N.  On input X must contain an initial
C         estimate of the solution vector.  On output X contains the
C         final estimate of the solution vector.
C
C       FVEC is an output array of length N which contains the functions
C         evaluated at the output X.
C
C       TOL is a nonnegative input variable.  Termination occurs when
C         the algorithm estimates that the relative error between X and
C         the solution is at most TOL.  Section 4 contains more details
C         about TOL.
C
C       NPRINT is an integer input variable that enables controlled
C         printing of iterates if it is positive.  In this case, FCN is
C         called with IFLAG = 0 at the beginning of the first iteration
C         and every NPRINT iterations thereafter and immediately prior
C         to return, with X and FVEC available for printing. Appropriate
C         print statements must be added to FCN(see example).  If NPRINT
C         is not positive, no special calls of FCN with IFLAG = 0 are
C         made.
C
C       INFO is an integer output variable.  If the user has terminated
C         execution, INFO is set to the (negative) value of IFLAG.  See
C         description of FCN and JAC. Otherwise, INFO is set as follows.
C
C         INFO = 0  Improper input parameters.
C
C         INFO = 1  Algorithm estimates that the relative error between
C                   X and the solution is at most TOL.
C
C         INFO = 2  Number of calls to FCN has reached or exceeded
C                   100*(N+1) for IOPT=1 or 200*(N+1) for IOPT=2.
C
C         INFO = 3  TOL is too small.  No further improvement in the
C                   approximate solution X is possible.
C
C         INFO = 4  Iteration is not making good progress.
C
C         Sections 4 and 5 contain more details about INFO.
C
C       WA is a work array of length LWA.
C
C       LWA is a positive integer input variable not less than
C         (3*N**2+13*N))/2.
C
C 4. Successful Completion.
C
C       The accuracy of DNSQE is controlled by the convergence parameter
C       TOL.  This parameter is used in a test which makes a comparison
C       between the approximation X and a solution XSOL.  DNSQE
C       terminates when the test is satisfied.  If TOL is less than the
C       machine precision (as defined by the  function D1MACH(4)), then
C       DNSQE only attempts to satisfy the test defined by the machine
C       precision.  Further progress is not usually possible.  Unless
C       high precision solutions are required, the recommended value
C       for TOL is the square root of the machine precision.
C
C       The test assumes that the functions are reasonably well behaved,
C       and, if the Jacobian is supplied by the user, that the functions
C       and the Jacobian are coded consistently. If these conditions are
C       not satisfied, then DNSQE may incorrectly indicate convergence.
C       The coding of the Jacobian can be checked by the subroutine
C       DCKDER.  If the Jacobian is coded correctly or IOPT=2, then
C       the validity of the answer can be checked, for example, by
C       rerunning DNSQE with a tighter tolerance.
C
C       Convergence Test.  If DENORM(Z) denotes the Euclidean norm of a
C         vector Z, then this test attempts to guarantee that
C
C               DENORM(X-XSOL) .LE. TOL*DENORM(XSOL).
C
C         If this condition is satisfied with TOL = 10**(-K), then the
C         larger components of X have K significant decimal digits and
C         INFO is set to 1.  There is a danger that the smaller
C         components of X may have large relative errors, but the fast
C         rate of convergence of DNSQE usually avoids this possibility.
C
C 5. Unsuccessful Completion.
C
C       Unsuccessful termination of DNSQE can be due to improper input
C       parameters, arithmetic interrupts, an excessive number of
C       function evaluations, errors in the functions, or lack of good
C       progress.
C
C       Improper Input Parameters.  INFO is set to 0 if IOPT .LT. 1, or
C         IOPT .GT. 2, or N .LE. 0, or TOL .LT. 0.E0, or
C         LWA .LT. (3*N**2+13*N)/2.
C
C       Arithmetic Interrupts.  If these interrupts occur in the FCN
C         subroutine during an early stage of the computation, they may
C         be caused by an unacceptable choice of X by DNSQE.  In this
C         case, it may be possible to remedy the situation by not
C         evaluating the functions here, but instead setting the
C         components of FVEC to numbers that exceed those in the initial
C         FVEC.
C
C       Excessive Number of Function Evaluations.  If the number of
C         calls to FCN reaches 100*(N+1) for IOPT=1 or 200*(N+1) for
C         IOPT=2, then this indicates that the routine is converging
C         very slowly as measured by the progress of FVEC, and INFO is
C         set to 2.  This situation should be unusual because, as
C         indicated below, lack of good progress is usually diagnosed
C         earlier by DNSQE, causing termination with INFO = 4.
C
C       Errors In the Functions.  When IOPT=2, the choice of step length
C         in the forward-difference approximation to the Jacobian
C         assumes that the relative errors in the functions are of the
C         order of the machine precision.  If this is not the case,
C         DNSQE may fail (usually with INFO = 4).  The user should
C         then either use DNSQ and set the step length or use IOPT=1
C         and supply the Jacobian.
C
C       Lack of Good Progress.  DNSQE searches for a zero of the system
C         by minimizing the sum of the squares of the functions.  In so
C         doing, it can become trapped in a region where the minimum
C         does not correspond to a zero of the system and, in this
C         situation, the iteration eventually fails to make good
C         progress.  In particular, this will happen if the system does
C         not have a zero.  If the system has a zero, rerunning DNSQE
C         from a different starting point may be helpful.
C
C 6. Characteristics of The Algorithm.
C
C       DNSQE is a modification of the Powell Hybrid method.  Two of
C       its main characteristics involve the choice of the correction as
C       a convex combination of the Newton and scaled gradient
C       directions, and the updating of the Jacobian by the rank-1
C       method of Broyden.  The choice of the correction guarantees
C       (under reasonable conditions) global convergence for starting
C       points far from the solution and a fast rate of convergence.
C       The Jacobian is calculated at the starting point by either the
C       user-supplied subroutine or a forward-difference approximation,
C       but it is not recalculated until the rank-1 method fails to
C       produce satisfactory progress.
C
C       Timing.  The time required by DNSQE to solve a given problem
C         depends on N, the behavior of the functions, the accuracy
C         requested, and the starting point.  The number of arithmetic
C         operations needed by DNSQE is about 11.5*(N**2) to process
C         each evaluation of the functions (call to FCN) and 1.3*(N**3)
C         to process each evaluation of the Jacobian (call to JAC,
C         if IOPT = 1).  Unless FCN and JAC can be evaluated quickly,
C         the timing of DNSQE will be strongly influenced by the time
C         spent in FCN and JAC.
C
C       Storage.  DNSQE requires (3*N**2 + 17*N)/2 single precision
C         storage locations, in addition to the storage required by the
C         program.  There are no internally declared storage arrays.
