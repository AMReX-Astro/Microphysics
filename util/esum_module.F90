! Fortran 2003 implementation of the msum routine
! provided by Raymond Hettinger:
! https://code.activestate.com/recipes/393090/
! This routine calculates the sum of N numbers
! exactly to within double precision arithmetic.
!
! For perfomance reasons we implement a specialized
! version of esum for each possible value of N >= 3.
!
! Also for performance reasons, we explicitly unroll
! the outer loop of the msum method into groups of 3
! (and a group of 4 at the end, for even N). This seems
! to be significantly faster, but should still be exact
! to within the arithmetic because each one of the
! individual msums is (although this does not necessarily
! mean that the result is the same).
!
! This routine is called "esum" for generality
! because in principle we could add implementations
! other than msum that do exact arithmetic, without
! changing the interface as seen in the networks.

    ! deletes array entries at the end of every outer loop iteration.
    ! The Fortran equivalent to this might be to just zero them out,
    ! but this results in a huge performance hit given how often
    ! this routine is called during in a burn. So we opt instead to
    ! just track how many of the values are meaningful, which j does
    ! automatically, and ignore any data in the remaining slots.

    ! These temporary variables need to be explicitly

    ! If the compiler optimizes away the statement
    ! lo = y - (hi - x), the approach fails. This could
    ! be avoided with the volatile keyword, but at the
    ! expense of forcing additional memory usage
    ! which would slow down the calculation. Instead
    ! we will rely on the compiler not to optimize
    ! the statement away. This should be true for gcc
    ! by default but is not necessarily true for all

    ! deletes array entries at the end of every outer loop iteration.
    ! The Fortran equivalent to this might be to just zero them out,
    ! but this results in a huge performance hit given how often
    ! this routine is called during in a burn. So we opt instead to
    ! just track how many of the values are meaningful, which j does
    ! automatically, and ignore any data in the remaining slots.

    ! These temporary variables need to be explicitly
    ! constructed for the algorithm to make sense.
    ! If the compiler optimizes away the statement
    ! lo = y - (hi - x), the approach fails. This could
    ! be avoided with the volatile keyword, but at the
    ! expense of forcing additional memory usage
    ! which would slow down the calculation. Instead
    ! we will rely on the compiler not to optimize
    ! the statement away. This should be true for gcc
    ! by default but is not necessarily true for all

    ! Indices for tracking the partials array.
    ! j keeps track of how many entries in partials are actually used.
    ! The algorithm we model this off of, written in Python, simply
    ! deletes array entries at the end of every outer loop iteration.
    ! The Fortran equivalent to this might be to just zero them out,
    ! but this results in a huge performance hit given how often
    ! this routine is called during in a burn. So we opt instead to
    ! just track how many of the values are meaningful, which j does
    ! automatically, and ignore any data in the remaining slots.
    integer :: i, j, k, km

    ! Note that for performance reasons we are not
    ! initializing any unused values in this array.
    real(rt) :: partials(0:4)

    ! Some temporary variables for holding intermediate data.
    real(rt) :: x, y, z

    ! These temporary variables need to be explicitly
    ! constructed for the algorithm to make sense.
    ! If the compiler optimizes away the statement
    ! lo = y - (hi - x), the approach fails. This could
    ! be avoided with the volatile keyword, but at the
    ! expense of forcing additional memory usage
    ! which would slow down the calculation. Instead
    ! we will rely on the compiler not to optimize
    ! the statement away. This should be true for gcc
    ! by default but is not necessarily true for all
    ! compilers. In particular, Intel does not do this
    ! by default, so you must use the -assume-protect-parens
    ! flag for ifort.
