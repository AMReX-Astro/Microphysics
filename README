This is a rewrite of Frank Timmes' aprox13 network.  The aprox13.tbz
was downloaded from his website on 2013-03-18.  We want to make it 
(1) threadsafe, (2) use VODE, and (3) work with an SDC methodology.

We mainly need from his package the following:

  -- RHS routines

  -- screening routines

  -- plasma neutrino loss routines

  -- final energy generation routine


We will use a numerical Jacobian with VODE to make things easier.

In particular, the following routines from the original package 
are not used:

  -- screen6 (never seems to have been called.  screen5 is used instead)

  -- snupp, snucno -- these are neutrino loss routines for H burning -- we
     are not modeling that
