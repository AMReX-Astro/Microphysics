# NSE Network Checking Script

This is a script for checking whether integrated mass fractions of
a reaction network will eventually match with the mass fractions
calculated via NSE equations.

Script will print out the mass fractions computed via direct integration
and the mass fraction obtained from the NSE equation. It also calculates
the absolute and relative differences between the two.
