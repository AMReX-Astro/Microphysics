This is how we convert the LaTeX docs to Sphinx.  We want to do so in
a way that preserves the ability to use LaTeX macros in math mode in
the Sphinx.  Since we are using MathJax to render the HTML, we do this
by adding a javascript file with the macros defined.

1. convert the .tex files to .rst

   Use the pandoc.sh script to do this.  First create a file called
   "textsymbols.tex" that has all of the LaTeX newcommands that apply
   only in TEXT MODE (not math).  These will just be converted inplace
   in the .rst, since they are not rendered by math.

   The script will send this textsymbols.tex into sphinx along with
   each .tex file.  Any special commands in math mode will be left
   intact.

   The .rst will be put into docs_new/.  Copy them into the Sphinx source/
   directory.

2. To create "newcommands" for the math rendering, we follow:

   http://paugargallo.com/posts/2016-05-05-sphinx-mathjax.html

   create a source/_templates/layout.html with:

{% extends "!layout.html" %}
{% set script_files = script_files + ["_static/mathjax_conf.js"] %}

   The create a file with the LaTeX newcommands you want to work in
   math mode (via MathJax).  Here it is mathsymbols.tex.  The script
   create_newcommands.py will read this and output the javascript that
   is needed for mathjax.  Run as:

   python3 create_newcommands.py > source/_static/mathjax_conf.js
